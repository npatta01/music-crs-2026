# Modal Setup

[Modal](https://modal.com) is used to run inference on cloud GPUs.

## Authenticate

```bash
uv run python -m modal setup
```

This opens a browser for OAuth. After completing it, your token is saved to `~/.modal.toml`.

## Verify setup

Run the smoke test to confirm your token works and a remote worker spins up:

```bash
uv run modal run other/modal_get_started.py
```

Expected output:

```
This code is running on a remote worker!
the square is 1764
```
